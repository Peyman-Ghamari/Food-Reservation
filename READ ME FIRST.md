Hello,

This is Peyman Ghamari.

I developed this food reservation system using a JSON database. While I could have installed JSON via VCPKG, I decided not to use it for this project. Instead, I included the JSON files directly in the project folder.

Please note that the application "Food Reservation\cmake-build-debug\Food_Reservation.exe" is designed to run on Windows x64 only. This is because I chose not to use VCPKG for configuring the necessary libraries Ù‘ For Other Devices.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. However, if you're not using Windows x64, you can still run this program through your IDE.

To view the code as HTML, please download the project and use the files in the exportToHTML folder.

Thank you for your understanding!
